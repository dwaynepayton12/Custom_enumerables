Custom Enumerables

This is a project where I have to recreate some buil-in methods from Enumerable module. This project heavily uses Blocks concept of Ruby.
Methods Recreated

    #my_each
    #my_each_with_index
    #my_select
    #my_all?
    #my_any?
    #my_none?
    #my_count
    #my_map
    #my_inject



this was a really good practice for creating enumerables
